# man-vs-food
community-driven online-platform related to food and nutrition. Based on MongoDB and Grails 3.

Had a little project idea yesterday and decided to get the groove going by digging into some new techs and learn some new tricks. Groovy, Grails and GSPs are going to be gradled together and strung up to a Mongo DB. Sounds groovy, right?

Blog with my learnings from this project can be found here:
